## What is this plugin for? 

This plugin allows you to leave a colored trail behind you. The user selects a picture and a color for it - this is what the trail is made up of. 

In the version, the source code of which is attached here, 31 images and 9 colors are available, for a total of 279 possible combinations! (In newer but lost version 40 images and 20 colors were available) 

At the same time, both the number of sprites and the possible colors can be increased without any problems!
