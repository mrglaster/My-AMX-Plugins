### What is this plugin for? 

This plugin allows VIP players or administrators of your server use some special models, unavailable for other players. 

The main difference between other similar plugins and this one is, this plugin was developed for Team Deathmath, in this case we can't use regular ways to change player model: in HL, each team has its own model and if in deathmatch it's not a problem, because in every case everyone fights each other, in team deathmatch it's a problem.

The plugin contains bugs, so use it as a base at your own risk.
