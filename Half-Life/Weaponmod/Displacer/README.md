### What is this plugin for?

This plugin adds the Displacer Cannon from the game Opposing Force. As a primary attack, the weapon fires a large energy ball that deals high splash damage. As an alternative - teleportation to a random player spawn point. The weapon has the same ammo as Gauss or Egon.

```For the plugin to work correctly, you must have Weaponmod installed on your server: ```https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=183369
