## What is this plugin for?

The plugin prints to the console a list of your weapons added by weaponmod, in the order in which they are loaded. 

Knowing this order is necessary, for example, when using Weaponbox Models: when using this plugin, you have to set the list of weapons manually, and without knowing the correct order in which weapons are loaded, Paladin may turn out to be Sporelauncher instead.

To use this plugin type ```wlist``` in the game console.
