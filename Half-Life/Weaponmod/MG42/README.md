### What is this plugin for? 

This plugin adds the MG42, World War II machine gun used by the German side of the conflict. 
When fired "from the hip" it has tremendous recoil and a large spread. 
But as soon as you put it on the bipod by pressing the RMB, the shooting accuracy begins to tend to 100%. In addition, if a teammate is near you (relevant for Team Deathmatch), then the rate of fire is increased by 2 times (because the teammate passes the ammo belt)

```For the plugin to work correctly, you must have Weaponmod installed on your server: ```https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=183369
