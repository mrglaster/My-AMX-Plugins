### What is this plugin for?

This plugin adds the OSIPR, Overwatch Standard Issue Pulse Rifle, or just AR2. 
This gun fires pulse ammo as its main attack. In addition, an underbarrel attachment is built into the rifle, which shoots energy balls bouncing off walls, floors, and ceilings.

```For the plugin to work correctly, you must have Weaponmod installed on your server: ```https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=183369
