## What is this plugin for? 

This plugin adds the Railgun from Quake II, the weapon firing an energy beam destroying  everything that moves (and everything that doesn't move it moves and destroys). To change the characteristics, change the corresponding parameters at the beginning of the plugin.

```For the plugin to work correctly, you must have Weaponmod installed on your server: ```https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=183369
